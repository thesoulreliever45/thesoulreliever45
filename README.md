🚀 Co-Founder & CEO, Vaxalor AI | AI Innovator | Startup Builder

I’m Anshul Shekhar, an all-rounder engineer turned entrepreneur, building at the frontier of artificial intelligence. As the Co-Founder & CEO of Vaxalor AI, I’m leading efforts to create intelligent, scalable, and automation-driven solutions—spanning AI agents, interactive voice systems, digital avatars, and autonomous workflows that reduce human labor and amplify efficiency.

From building with Python, LangChain, Hugging Face, RAG, and LLM pipelines, to working hands-on with ComfyUI, Transformers, and Agentic frameworks, I actively transform theoretical AI into deployable, real-world systems. My current obsession lies in crafting practical tools that make everyday processes simpler, smarter, and more autonomous.

💡 Whether it’s AI-driven process automation or reimagining how businesses interact with customers, I’m on a mission to shape Vaxalor AI into a company that doesn’t just build products—but builds impact.

 Ex-President, ISTE-ABESIT Student Chapter
 Core Team, GDSC’22 | Kalrav Club | IIC-ABESIT
 Team Coordinator, Light De Literacy NGO
